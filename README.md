## Challenge Background

The Nigerian economy has experienced a significant surge in prices across various sectors, from daily commodities to services and products. This rapid change has impacted living conditions across different states, prompting a detailed analysis of key economic pillars such as incomes, expenditures, and savings capabilities of citizens.

## Goal of the Project

This project aims to provide a clear and actionable overview of the economic impact of price surges in Nigeria, facilitating informed decision-making and policy development.

The goal also is to present a graphical overview of the price increases in selected basic living needs. These include:

- Food Items: Tracking the price changes in staple foods.
- Cost of Transportation: Monitoring the cost variations in public and private transportation.
- Taxation: Observing changes in tax rates and their implications.
- Wages: Comparing the wage trends against the rising cost of living.
- Healthcare: Analyzing the cost fluctuations in essential healthcare services.
- Essential Commodities: Investigating the price movements of key commodities.

## Data Collection and Indicators

Data has been collected on various indicators essential for analyzing price surges in Nigeria. The detailed tracking of these indicators can be found in our [Indicators/Features Tracker](https://github.com/adiimated/Nigerian-Economic-Impact-2024/tree/main/data%20collection/feature%20tracker).

* Comprehensive tracking of metrics such as government expenditure, trade openness, GDP, unemployment rate, oil production, inflation rate, exchange rate, and more.
* Data sourced from reputable databases like CBN, World Bank, NBS, and others.

## Data Preprocessing
Data was cleaned and preprocessed. After that the multiple file were merged based on their starting year/month
- `1960 Onwards`
- `1980 Onwards`
- `1990 Onwards`
- `2000 Onwards`
